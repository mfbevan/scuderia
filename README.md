- 🏎️ Scuderia.sol is the genesis NFT contract for minting your Scuderia Racing NFT. It also enabled self custodial, time-limited staking
  

- 💰 Scoot.sol is the utility token earned by holding Scuderia NFTs. You will earn 10 $SCT per day for each Scuderia token you hold  
  

- 🏁 Racing.sol (still to come) fully on-chain racing contract  
  

<br/>  

The goal of this project is to create a fully on-chain racing NFT ecosystem that allows minting, metadata and image generation, racing and betting entirely on-chain. We will aim to keep as much of the project as decentralised as possible, avoiding the need for a database and API as much as possible. Contracts will be deployed to Polygon.

<br/>

NOTE: Feel free to use any of the code in this repository for your own projects. None of the contracts in this repository have been audited, and I take no responsibility for issues which may arise out of their extended use.
