### <div align="center">Ferrari's Formula 1 racing team is called Scuderia Ferrari, with Scuderia¬†translating from Italian as ‚Äústable.‚Äù</div>  
  

- üèéÔ∏è Scuderia.sol is the genesis NFT contract for minting your Scuderia Racing NFT. It also enabled self custodial, time-limited staking
  

- üí∞ Scoot.sol is the utility token earned by holding Scuderia NFTs. You will earn 10 $SCT per day for each Scuderia token you hold  
  

- üèÅ Racing.sol (still to come) fully on-chain racing contract  
  

<br/>  

The goal of this project is to create a fully on-chain racing NFT ecosystem that allows minting, metadata and image generation, racing and betting entirely on-chain. We will aim to keep as much of the project as decentralised as possible, avoiding the need for a database and API as much as possible. Contracts will be deployed to Polygon.

<br/>

NOTE: Feel free to use any of the code in this repository for your own projects. None of the contracts in this repository have been audited, and I take no responsibility for issues which may arise out of their extended use.

## Test Coverage

Missing test coverage is on functions which have protective functionality on internal functions which are difficult to test within a hardhat environment
